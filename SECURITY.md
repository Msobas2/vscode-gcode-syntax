# Reporting Security Issues

Our team takes security bugs in our extension very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any findings, and will make every efford to acknowledge your contributions.

We try to keep all of the dependencies updated whenever possible.

Because this is a plugin to VSCode, to report a security issue or vulnerability, please verify that the issue is with our plugin and if so, submit an [issue](https://github.com/appliedengdesign/vscode-gcode-syntax/issues), otherwise, submit an issue with the [VSCode project](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
